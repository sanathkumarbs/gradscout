his career pathway concentrates on the theories and supporting techniques related to the design, building, and management of  information systems and Web applications. These include:

Design and development of user-centered information systems in a variety of information environments
User interactions with information structures
Computer/network mediated interaction with users
Web applications
Web site design, content creation and administration
Web-programming languages
Students in this career path will develop skills and expertise to improve the user's experience when interacting with information systems via web interfaces. Work in information systems and design requires more than just the acquisition of a practical skill set. It is the ability to tailor technologies to various information communities. It also requires an understanding of usersâ€™ information needs and knowledge about the information-seeking behaviors of the audience.

Employment Opportunities

Opportunities exist in all types of libraries as well as information agencies, library automation system vendors, and Web design companies. Sometimes the whole job will focus on technology; sometimes part of the job will consist of designing, building, and maintaining Web content. Students who concentrate in this specialization may work as:

systems librarians
database coordinators
database developers
data mining and analytics consultants
emerging technologies librarians
information architects
intelligence analysts
knowledge integration librarians
project managers
reference tool developers
systems analysts
technology coordinators and trainers
usability/usage analysts
user experience designers
virtual services managers
Web 2.0 developers
Web content managers
Web designers
Web project managers
Web technologists
Core Theory and Knowledge

Ability to analyze and determine library computing requirements, develop new means of delivering service, coordinate and implement new electronic services, and support ongoing services
Communicate ideas to peers as well as clientele without the overuse of technical jargon
Identify specific needs for technologies in information search and management
Match needs in specific situations with the functions and applications of emerging technologies
Utilize data mining software tools for usage and analytics research
Understand computing fundamentals (data structures, operating systems, usability issues, Web site design and creation, Web programming/scripting languages, Web 2.0 tools)
Understand the principles of user-centric design and style, as well as how to choose appropriate interaction methods for particular circumstances and populations

Information Architecture
Organize and structure information to improve findability and discoverability
The Information Architecture (IA), or organization, of a website or application is critical, because it determines whether or not users are successful in finding desired information and completing tasks. This course introduces the core components of a good IA, as well as essential IA design methods and strategies.

"In just one day, this course provided me with actionable items I will use to both improve and add onto the IA of my company's website. The course also gave me a new perspective on how to analyze my website and the most important aspects I should focus on improving."
Laura Normile
HD Supply Facilities Maintenance
