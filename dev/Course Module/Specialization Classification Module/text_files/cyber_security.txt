The online Master of Engineering in cybersecurity policy and compliance at GW is designed for students who are working professionals—blending live class sessions with coursework that can be completed around other obligations. Students who are employed full-time will be able to apply the skills they learn on the job as they complete their online cybersecurity courses.
The program requires a minimum of 30 credit hours of graduate-level coursework. The program consists of four computer science courses and six others, focusing on policy, management, compliance and risk management—a blend that is designed to develop a well-rounded skillset in graduates. Even for those working full-time, all cybersecurity courses can be completed in roughly 2.5 years.
Upon graduation, M.Eng(CPC) students will be able to:
Implement appropriate forensic analysis of cyber incidents, and use predictive analytics modeling to forecast cyberattacks, to devise solutions that go beyond traditional IT practitioners’ practices to delineate specific and actionable cyber intelligence.
Formulate short- and long-term cybersecurity strategies and policies for their enterprises by identifying compliance laws and applying the industry’s best practices.
Design an organization’s mobility solution that integrates mobile device management and the industry’s best practices.
Develop and implement a comprehensive cybersecurity situational awareness procedure for an organization to safeguard sensitive data and sustain fundamental operations.
Implement methods of mitigating risk by managing threat vulnerabilities and exploits.

Information Assurance and Cybersecurity

Protecting the most important digital information assets
According to the Department of Homeland Security, cyber intrusions and attacks have increased dramatically over the last decade, exposing sensitive personal and business information, disrupting critical operations, and imposing high costs on the economy. Anyone connected to the internet is vulnerable.

iSchool research is identifying new ways to protect critical public and private information infrastructure; helping organizations monitor potential security risks; and developing courses and real-world simulations to educate information assurance and cybersecurity professionals.

Applicability
The iSchool’s expertise and research in information assurance and cyber security can assist organizations in the following ways:

Risk assessment and management
Developing security policies and rights management systems
Identifying security awareness issues within organizations and recommending processes to overcome them
Implementing or integrating security tools and applications
Assessing software and information architecture for security
Assessing network security
Implementing intrusion detection, forensics and timely response processes
Protecting privacy and increasing awareness
Implementing next generation infrastructure and applications
Detection of emerging opinions and opinion leaders in emerging media
Projects and Research

Next Generation Honeypots
Honey Pot Systems are decoy servers or systems setup to gather information regarding an attacker or intruder into your system. The iSchool is assessing the use of virtualization in networks and incorporating deception techniques into the next generation of honey pots.

The Uncertainty and Leadership Detection Project
The Institute for National Security Education and Research (INSER) focuses on using natural language processing tools to examine emerging online communities and identify existing and potential leaders.

The Trust and Suspicion Project
INSER team is able to characterize the levels of trust and suspicion about online activities in collaborative team members, particularly information security professionals. The goal is to increase understanding about the interactions between professionals around security awareness and risk assessment.
