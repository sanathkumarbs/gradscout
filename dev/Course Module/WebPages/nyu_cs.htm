<h3>Capstone Course Requirement</h3>
<p>Certain courses in our department will be designated as capstone courses. Capstone courses are drawn from key technical areas in the MS program and they involve a substantial amount of programming effort. Students are required to take at least one capstone course with a grade of B or better. The list of capstone courses will be posted by the department and will be updated from time to time. If a course is listed both as a capstone course and as a core course, the course can be used to satisfy both the capstone and core course requirements. An MS thesis can also be used to satisfy the capstone course requirement.&nbsp;</p>
