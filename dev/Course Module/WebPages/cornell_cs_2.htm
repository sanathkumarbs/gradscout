                      <p>This studio-based course helps students develop their ability to imagine, recognize, develop and improve startup ideas. In each class, students learn a different approach to product ideation or product critique, then practice that approach, working in many different teams -- often with the advice of visiting entrepreneurs, VCs, domain experts, and other practitioners. Students invent and explore hundreds of startup ideas, and help each other evaluate and improve those ideas. By the end of the course, students self-organize into co-founding teams around specific startup ideas that they will pursue in Startup Studio the following semester.</p>

In each session, students learn about a different aspect of product management, product design, or technology development, then practice applying it to their Startup Studio projects, working in the Studio with their project teams and with the help and critique of the practitioner instructors and sometimes visiting practitioners. By the end of the semester, students will have developed and practiced many of the fundamental product management skills required to develop new technology products, and their Startup Studio projects will have greatly benefited from the practice.

          <p>This core ECE course covers the basics of signal processing and data analysis. The first half of the course covers the fundamentals of signals and systems, including the discrete Fourier transform, transfer functions, adaptive filtering and applications in noise cancellation and communication systems.

The second half covers the basics of probabilistic models, stochastic simulation Markov processes and Bayesian inference. Finally, topics in high dimensional signal processing including model selection, sparse signal processing and principal component analysis are covered. Throughout the course, applications in communication systems, sensing systems and machine learning will be emphasized.</p>

          <p>This course aims to bridge the gap between academic studies of computer science and practical software engineering. The course provides a fast-paced introduction to key tools, techniques and best practices to facilitate the building of prototypes and the deployment of user-facing working systems. It introduces technologies for building Web and mobile applications; systems for effective storage and processing of data; and tools to write, test, build, deploy and monitor code. The course will also emphasize challenges and trade-offs related to security and performance. The class will have "labs" and homeworks where students will implement and deploy working systems.</p>

          <p>Business for Technologists (BT) is a comprehensive introduction to the key aspects of new product development and product management that will provide helpful perspective for technologists working in cross functional teams with business leaders in the marketing, product, finance, legal and business development disciplines. BT focuses both on concepts and frameworks utilizing “solutions architecture” while working on cross functional teams in both agile and waterfall development environments. Students will utilize their team projects as the basis to complete customer development, market segmentation, product placement, construct business models and define “proof points” and milestones that lead to successful outcomes for teams comprised of both technologists and subject matter experts from a broad array of business disciplines. The course will also discuss the development of an “intellectual property suite” and its importance in the new product development process and relevance to the competitive landscape. While the course focuses on scalable businesses, the principles apply to businesses of all sizes. Topics covered will include definition of the market, sales and distribution, competition, business development, project management and milestone based performance tracking. The course culminates in a capstone project of writing a launch plan for a new technology product’s market test.</p>

The guest practitioners are active entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, social entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, artists, VCs, lawyers, writers, ethicists, and other diverse leaders who are affecting society through their entrepreneurial efforts. Conversations take place in the Cornell Tech Studio and are moderated each week by a randomly assigned group of students who come prepared with questions and discussion topics.

          <p>This class introduces the principal legal issues involved in starting, managing and operating a technology-oriented business by entrepreneurs. It is intended to provide non-law students with an understanding of many of the laws and regulations to which developing businesses in the United States tech sector are typically subject—from the time an entrepreneur conceives and begins to build a business, implements a business plan, and obtains financing, to when she begins operations in anticipation of managing a mature company and considering possible exit strategies.

The instructor, a former corporate partner in a large New York City law firm, will adopt the role of a general counsel to a start-up company advising his client/students about how laws and regulations affect their businesses at various stages of development, as well as about typical key contractual terms and negotiating strategies. Practicing lawyers will serve as guest lecturers. 

The course is designed to impart an understanding not only about substantive areas of the law that intersect with tech businesses but also about the role that lawyers should—and should not—play in burgeoning business enterprises. Students will gain insights into how lawyers approach business problems and the benefits and limitations of such a perspective.</p>

In each session, students learn about a different aspect of product management, product design, or technology development, then practice applying it to their Startup Studio projects, working in the Studio with their project teams and with the help and critique of the practitioner instructors and sometimes visiting practitioners. By the end of the semester, students will have developed and practiced many of the fundamental product management skills required to develop new technology products, and their Startup Studio projects will have greatly benefited from the practice.
