This course will introduce major issues involved with the science and management of primarily digital information and prepare students for more advanced courses in the field. The course is organized into modules that may cover topics such as social bookmarking, networks and web security, human-computer interaction, interface design, technology and poverty, law and policy, business models, and entrepreneurship.  Students will develop their research, evaluation, analysis, and synthesis skills and demonstrate these through completing a course-long group project addressing an information problem of their group's choice.</p>
<p>Students from most disciplines will be interested in the topics covered in this course and will find the course objectives valuable when applied to their own fields. Additionally, students who are interested in the field of information studies will take this course in order to be introduced to the key concepts as well as future graduate studies at schools of information.</p>
<p><strong>Course Format:</strong><br />
Info 10 is a fully web-based course. Lectures will be available online, but will not be assigned a particular time or classroom. Discussion sections meet online at the assigned times.</p></div>  </div>  </div>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-course-long-description">        <div class="field-content"><p>A fast-paced introduction to the Python programming language geared toward students of data science. The course introduces a range of Python objects and control structures, then builds on these with classes on object-oriented programming. The last section of the course is devoted to Python’s system of packages for data analysis. Students will gain experience in different styles of programming, including scripting, object-oriented design, test-driven design, and functional programming. Aside from Python, the course also covers use of the command line, coding and presentation with Jupyter notebooks, and source control with Git and GitHub. This is an online course; students will attend regular live online sessions as well as reviewing recorded material.</p>

<p>This course is conducted entirely online, so students do not need to be on the Berkeley campus in order to participate. However, live session attendance via our course management software is required, so students will attend class as a group on a weekly basis. Students will also view recorded content as a supplement to the live session meetings. Exact section days and times will be announced soon.</p></div>  </div>  </div>

It blends social and historical perspectives on data with ethics, policy, and case examples to help students develop a workable understanding of current ethical issues in data science. Ethical and policy-related concepts addressed include: research ethics; privacy and surveillance; data and discrimination; and the “black box” of algorithms. Importantly, these issues will be addressed throughout the lifecycle of data — from collection to storage to analysis and application. Course assignments will emphasize researcher and practitioner reflexivity, allowing students to explore their own social and ethical commitments.</p>

<p>Student Learning Outcomes: Upon completion of the course, students will be able to critically assess their own work and education in the area of data science; to identify and articulate basic ethical and policy-based frameworks; and to understand the relationship between data, ethics, and society</p></div>  </div>  </div>

This course will guide students through the elements that compose any programming language including expressions, control of flow, data structures, and modularity via functions and/or objects. Covers traditional and contemporary programming paradigms including sequential, event-based, and object-oriented programming. Students will also work towards writing code that integrates multiple input/output modes. Programming style, multi-person programming projects, and debugging strategies will be covered as well. Uses the PYTHON language.</p>
<p>In addition to the regular class meeting there will be other group meetings.</p>
<p>This course is restricted to first-semester graduate students in the School of Information.</p>
<p>Graduate students will receive course credit, but because this is a lower-division course, the credit may not be applied toward the master's or doctoral degree unit requirements.</p>
<h3>Course format:</h3>
<p>There will be a mixture of lectures and group tutorials.  The assignments will be a mix of individual and team work, with probably a total of six to ten for the semester.  Some of the assignments will be gone over in class.  There will be a final team-based programming project.  </p>
<p>The course will not run for the full 14 weeks of the fall semester.  The current plan is to end just before Thanksgiving.  We have applied for permission to increase the course to three units to reflect the amount of work and the commitment we expect from the students.  </p></div>  </div>  </div>

We will study the interplay of computing with present struggles in the privatization of education, intellectual property, militarization, mass surveillance, labor, gender, sexuality, race, coloniality/decoloniality, and transnational activism. Questions to be addressed include: how do financial, legal, and algorithmic, and other domains of control shape global flows of information? How do old concepts in social theory (e.g., the ‘public sphere’) translate to the digital context? How can we propose technological interventions without reproducing naïve solutionism or false universalism?</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-course-long-description">        <div class="field-content"><p>How can we critically think about emergent phenomena of the Internet? Is the Internet a democratic medium for political action (a "networked public sphere") or a surveillance apparatus of centralized control? Who has access to digital information and what techniques are used to make information artificially scarce? How do trade group lawsuits against digital "piracy" affect a generation's perception of the law? Should we look at the growing sphere of copyright as a public interest problem, or celebrate the expansion of creators' rights? Can free software thrive independently from ideological backing? Why are peer production communities like Wikipedia and Linux affected by extreme gender disparity?</p>

<p>In this course, we will examine the societal implications of computer networks from critical and technical perspectives. We will collectively engage with issues of intellectual property, access to information, privacy, freedom of speech, representation, and peer production. We will be discussing provocative texts and media, doing hands-on exploration of emerging technologies, and practicing ethnographic fieldwork in online communities. We will also offer opportunities for field trips and guest speakers to provide us with different perspectives. Additionally, students will engage in a semester-long collaborative project in a flexible format.</p>

But the issues we are wrestling with now—questions about piracy, privacy, trust, “information overload,” and the replacement of old media by new—all have their roots in the informational cultures of earlier periods. In this class we will take a long view of the development of these cultures and technologies, from the earliest cave painting and writing systems to the advent of print, photography and the telegraph to the emergence of the computer and Internet and the world of Twitter, Pinterest and beyond. In every instance, be focused on the chicken-and-egg questions of technological determinism: how do technological developments affect society and vice-versa?</p></div>  </div>  </div>

The goal of the course is to prepare students to participate in this process of innovation by analyzing the emerging genres of New Media and their history, and by designing new media.</p>
<p>To analyze the design challenges and opportunities of this moment, the class will examine key moments in media history — such as the introduction of the printing press, the telephone, and the camera — to gain perspective on the nature of the process of technological innovation and cultural change. Then the course will analyze the design of new media in the camera, the telephone, the web and computer games, using insights and methods from the humanities (i.e., theories of language, communication, and media), using social science techniques to analyze culture and media (i.e., participant-observation, interviewing) and applying basic computational understandings and skills (i.e., how computers work, what programs are, how to write simple programs). Weekly assignments will introduce and build these skills throughout the semester, using lectures, readings and lab sections to introduce basic techniques for the analysis and design of New Media.</p>

<p>From criminal justice to health care to municipal services, civic technology is transforming the public sector. Taught by experts from the California Department of Justice, this course explores the emerging disciplines of data science, digital services, and user­-centered design and their implications for government and public policy.</p>

<p>Data products can provide clarity on impact, helping to identify which policies and practices are working, and where interventions are most needed. Digital services that integrate data and user-centered design are helping governments a) deliver in ways that are both convenient and cost-effective for the public, b) build trust by providing transparency into and accountability for how institutions are functioning, and c) engage the civic-minded community to build ongoing constructive feedback mechanisms. On the other hand, the use of these approaches also poses unique challenges, ranging from poor data quality, to (mis)interpretation of statistics, to difficulty in conveying insights, and using those insights to transform operations and service delivery.</p>

<p>This course will use recent events in the criminal justice system and the California Department of Justice’s new OpenJustice initiative (<a href="http://openjustice.doj.ca.gov">http://openjustice.doj.ca.gov</a>) as a central case study to understand the challenges and solution space for data-driven public policy. It will cover the full life cycle: from the dynamics of passing data legislation, to data collection and sharing, to data analysis (statistics, machine learning), publication (open data, visualization, dashboards), engagement strategies, and policy making.  It will explore the challenge of ensuring that data is actionable for internal and external users, that it is acted-upon, and that it actually informs and improves services and service delivery.</p>

<p>Overall, the goal is for students to understand the various components required to move from the limited uses of data as a “box-checking” exercise to a primary policy driver. Students will explore these topics via individual and group-based projects, including hands-on classroom assignments. The mid-term project will include a legislative proposal for new data collection and an implementation plan. The final project will include robust analysis of existing data, visualizations of findings, and an engagement plan. Data sets will be drawn from the OpenJustice portal as well as other public safety, public health and education data sources.</p>

<p>Knowledge of Excel is recommended; familiarity with statistical programming in Python or similar languages may be helpful but not required. Recommendations for resources to learn these skills will be provided as part of the course.</p>

<p>This course is intended to be 2 units but is currently awaiting Academic Senate approval to be offered with this unit count. Students may notice that the official CalCentral listing currently indicates 3 units. Check back later in August for updates.</p></div>  </div>  </div>

<p>Information and Communications Technology for Development (ICTD) is the broad study of information technology to alleviate poverty and stimulate development (economic, social, and human) in developing and transitional countries. In the last 15 years, there has been an exponential expansion in the number of ICTD projects, but insufficient human skills to design and manage them, leading to a “forever-pilot” culture and a rather dismal failure rate. Successful oversight of these projects requires a combination of interdisciplinary and dynamic skills. This course serves to introduce students to these skills under three areas of competencies:</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><strong>A. Contextual</strong>: Broader conceptual, policy-level frameworks of understanding the landscape of ICTD.</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><strong>B. Technical</strong>: The different ways in which ICTs, through e-applications, can contribute to socioeconomic development. While specific computer skills are important, this course given its broad reach will focus on applications.</p>

<p class="rteindent1"><strong>C. Management</strong>: Methods and techniques of project program planning and management, including assessment, design, funding, implementation, and evaluation.</p>

<p>Along with these areas, we will explore cross-cutting themes such as politics, gender, culture, and the reality of development work.</p>

<p>Students will be introduced to these skills through lectures and discussions (face-to face and online), as well as application to cases (possibly live consulting cases). Expect to have a lot of fun while working hard — not unlike development work in real life!</p></div>  </div>  </div>

As a result, this course will continuously introduce students to applied and practical problems, theoretical issues, as well as methods for answering different types of questions.</p>

<p>The following three questions will guide the material throughout the course: 1) Why do social scientists study information and information technology, 2) What are some of the key topics and issues that are studied, and 3) How do we study these issues? As we work our way through many different topics and problems in information, we will focus on various levels of analysis. This includes the micro (i.e., interpersonal relationships and information in small groups) to the macro level (i.e., organizational and institutional problems of information). By the end of the course, all students will be familiar with the social science approach to information and information technology, as well as many of the key problems and the methods used to solve these problems. This knowledge is essential to having a well-rounded understanding of information issues in professional environments.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-course-long-description">        <div class="field-content"><p>Science and Technology Studies (STS) is an interdisciplinary field concerned with two areas of interest to us: the interaction between technology and the social; and knowledge communities. Recent years have seen increased interaction between STS and human-computer interaction (HCI), information and communication technologies for development (ICTD), and new media.</p>

<p>This class will be a seminar emphasizing close reading and discussion of some classic STS works, along with more current research, emphasizing that which is relevant to information and computing technologies, and knowledge communities. Our concern will be with how these can help us understand the relationships among information technology and new media, especially design; knowledge communities; and the social.</p>

<p>Topics will depend in part on who’s in the class and people’s interests. Past years' topics include Social Construction of Technology (SCOT), Actor-Network Theory (ANT), Activity Theory, configuring users, epistemic cultures, situated action, reflective/critical HCI, and distributed cognition. Some of these topics are introduced in I203 but, of necessity, not in the depth. In I212, we address how these topics are useful for understanding the relationships among information technology, design, and the social. This course won’t help you get a job, but it may help you better understand what you are doing and why.</p>

<p>This class is open to any interested graduate student. It is particularly appropriate for I School Ph.D. students; I School master’s students interested in conceptual issues underlying some of their more applied coursework; and graduate students doing a new media emphasis, and from related departments. Past students have been from departments as varied as architecture, mechanical engineering, and education.</p></div>  </div>  </div>

<p>We will primarily take a social scientific approach to computer-mediated communication (including research from psychology, social psychology, economics, and sociology). We will investigate questions such as: How do we represent identity and perceive others in CMC environments? How are interfaces and visualizations used in CMC to help make sense of relationships? Why do some Wikis "succeed" while others do not? How is the production of open source software such as Linux similar to (and different from) a social movement? Why are reputations useful in some online environments, and not in others? Can we really develop meaningful relationships and perhaps even love-purely through CMC?</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-course-long-description">        <div class="field-content"><p>“Information” is a versatile word. It’s the name we attach to the age we live in, to and the technologies that define it, to the society and economy that they give rise to, and to the "revolution" that these technologies launch. It characterizes a variety of professions, activities, and social conditions (information architect, CIO, information overload, information haves and have-nots, information warfare), and not incidentally the new faculties that take “information” as their unifying focus. The word figures as a theoretical or technical term in a number of disciplines, including AI, computer science, philosophy, psychology, linguistics, economics, political science and information theory. In short, the word stands (along with its sister “data”) for a welter of social, technological and intellectual connections that seem to define a large swath of modern life.</p>

<p>In this class, we will not be trying to define “information” or “data” (though we’ll look at some attempts to do so). Rather we want to take the word as a point of entry to explore the connections and ideologies that it evokes. Why do people assume, for example, that the bits and bytes sitting on their hard drives are the same as the stuff that creates social revolutions and whose free exchange is necessary to the health of democratic society? (Would we make those connections if we didn’t use the word “information” to describe them?) How are the notions of information deployed by management science or artificial intelligence connected to the information theory developed by Shannon?</p>

<p>We’ll be taking on these questions by discussing readings both from historical periods and from a range of disciplines, focusing on the some of notions (such as “information,” “data,” “platform,” “technology,” “knowledge”) that seem to connect them.</p>

Students who seek careers in these industries will soon be asked to manage people, teams, departments, and units. They need to learn how to manage. However, managing is sometimes very different in these settings: Employees are highly educated; work is more fluid; teamwork and collaboration are essential; and external situations and strategies change rapidly. For these reasons several management principles born in a traditional manufacturing era no longer apply. In particular, the old style of “command and control” needs to give way to more distributed ways of work, with significant consequences for how managers need to manage. Of course, some universal management principles apply no matter what circumstance. </p>
<p>While we will cover these universal management principles in this course, we will pay particular attention to management issues that are highly relevant in information-intensive settings. Topics to be covered will likely include: managing knowledge workers; managing teams (incl. virtual ones); collaborating across disparate units, giving and receiving feedback;  managing the innovation process (incl. in eco-systems); managing through networks; and managing when using communication tools (e.g., tele-presence). The course will rely heavily on cases as a pedagogical form. </p>

The emergence of global digital networks, such as the Internet, and digital technologies that enhance human abilities to access, store, manipulate, and transmit vast amounts of information has brought with it a host of new legal issues that lawyers preparing to practice in the 21st century will need to understand and address. Although many are trying to "map" existing legal concepts onto problems arising in cyberspace, it is becoming increasingly evident that this strategy sometimes doesn't work. In some cases, it is necessary to go back to first principles to understand how to accomplish the purposes of existing law in digital networked environments. The course will explore specific problems in applying law to cyberspace in areas such as intellectual property, privacy, content control, and the bounds of jurisdiction. Students with familiarity with the Internet and its resources or with backgrounds in some of the substantive fields explored in this course are especially welcome, but there are no formal prerequisites. Grades for the course will be based either on a series of short papers or on a supervised term paper.

This course will provide an overview of the intellectual property laws with which information managers need to be familiar. It will start with a consideration of trade secrecy law that information technology and other firms routinely use to protect commercially valuable information. It will then consider the role that copyright law plays in the legal protection of information products and services. Although patents for many years rarely were available to protect information innovations, patents on such innovations are becoming increasingly common. As a consequence, it is necessary to consider standards of patentability and the scope of protection that patent affords to innovators. Trademark law allows firms to protect words or symbols used to identify their goods or services and to distinguish them from the goods and services of other producers. It offers significant protection to producers of information products and services. Because so many firms license intellectual property rights, some coverage of licensing issues is also important. Much of the course will concern the legal protection of computer software and databases, but it will also explore some intellectual property issues arising in cyberspace.</p></div>  </div>  </div>

<p>In this class, we take a broad view of entrepreneurship — including starting new businesses, non-profit initiatives, and/or public sector projects. We will take a highly iterative, design-oriented, feedback-driven approach to developing and refining business plans for social enterprises. At each stage, students will receive feedback from both experts and their peers. Ideas will be refined and expanded over the course of the semester by multi-disciplinary project teams, including the development of rough prototypes, identification of partners, determination of social impact metrics, and formulation of an operational strategy for pilot-testing the idea, demonstrating the potential for impact and generating sustainable funding. </p>
<p>The final deliverable will be a business plan and/or project proposal describing a product or service with a comprehensive implementation plan, including necessary partnerships, a funding/revenue model and appropriate next steps. These will be presented to a panel of experts for assessing their feasibility and potential for impact. The winning plan will be provided seed funding for travel over winter break to further flesh out their ideas and firm up partnerships. Course faculty and mentors will help students throughout this process, including in writing proposals for seed funding, or submitting to a social business plan competition, like GSVC.</p>

In this course, UC Berkeley professors and Twitter engineers will lecture on the most cutting-edge algorithms and software tools for data analytics as applied to Twitter microblog data. Topics will include applied natural language processing algorithms such as sentiment analysis, large scale anomaly detection, real-time search, information diffusion and outbreak detection, trend detection in social streams, recommendation algorithms, and advanced frameworks for distributed computing. Social science perspectives on analyzing social media will also be covered.</p>

<p>This is a hands-on project course in which students are expected to form teams to complete intensive programming and analytics projects using the real-world example of Twitter data and code bases. Engineers from Twitter will help advise student projects, and students will have the option of presenting their final project presentations to an audience of engineers at the headquarters of Twitter in San Francisco (in addition to on campus). Project topics include building on existing infrastructure tools, building Twitter apps, and analyzing Twitter data. Access to data will be provided.</p>

<p><strong>Intended audience:</strong><br />
	This course is intended for students, both graduate and undergraduate, with programming skills and an interest in analyzing data and/or building software to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong><br />
	Undergraduates must be upper-division computer science or electrical engineering majors, or must have taken significant advanced programming courses including CS 162 and math courses including CS 70 or equivalent. Completion of a statistics course is also strongly recommended.</p>

Recent examples from the research literature show how satellite imagery and deep learning can be used to identify and target pockets of extreme poverty; how mobile phone metadata can help track and stop the spread of malaria and Ebola; how social media analytics can improve disaster response; and how machine learning algorithms can help smallholder farmers optimize planting and harvesting decisions – to name just a few examples.</p>

<p>Through a careful reading of recent research papers and through hands-on analysis of large-scale datasets, this course introduces students to the opportunities and challenges for data-intensive approaches to international development. Students should be prepared to dissect, discuss, and replicate academic publications from several fields including development economics, machine learning, information science, and computational social science. Students will also conduct original statistical and computational analysis of real-world data, and are expected to have prior graduate training in machine learning, econometrics, or a related field.</p></div>  </div>  </div>

<p>In this graduate-level course (open to all departments, especially those in the humanities and social sciences), we will pursue two ends: we will investigate the landscape of modern quantitative methods for treating data as a lens onto the world, surveying a range of methods in machine learning and data analysis that leverage information produced by people in order to draw inferences (such as discerning the authorship of documents and the political position of social media users, charting the reuse of language in legislative bills, tagging the genres of songs, and extracting social networks from literary texts). Second, we will cast a critical eye on those methods, and investigate the assumptions those algorithms make about the world and the data through which we see it, in order to understand their limitations and when to apply them. How and when can empirical methods support other forms of argumentation, and what are their limits?</p>

<p>Many of these techniques are shared among the nascent communities of practice known as “computational social science”, “computational journalism” and the “digital humanities”; this course provides foundational skills for students to conduct their own research in these areas.</p>

<ul><li>
		<p>Work with a team that includes different backgrounds, interests, and personal motivations. As a cross-listed course, teams may or may not include students from different schools across the University (depending upon enrollment).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Experience a process for identifying and prioritizing opportunities to innovate. The process scales from an entrepreneur working alone to Fortune 500 firms managing an innovation portfolio.</p>

		<p>Formulate hypotheses and then design and execute experiments in a Lean cycle of build, measure and learn.</p>
	</li>
</ul><p>Teams will learn general principles of product/service design in the context of tools, methods, and concepts specific to the Web-based environment. Both desktop and mobile products and services are prototyped in the Web context to leverage common development and testing resources. For purposes of the course, the product or service should be aimed at consumers in the range 25 - 45. We define this target audience so that we can use classmates as preliminary subjects of interviews, testing, and surveys. For the purposes of this course, the product or service need not have a compelling business model. The focus is on creating a product or service that solves a real problem, not necessarily creating a new business.</p>

<p>This course teaches a process-oriented approach to product and service design with heavy emphasis on user experience design. Students interested in design aesthetics, semiotics and cognitive psychology should look elsewhere. Neither is this a class about technology. The course syllabus does not include tutorials on specific software packages. Students interested in technical questions such as platform selection and scaling should look elsewhere.</p>

<p>Designing Mobile Experiences will start with an overview of current device and OS differences, featuring guest lecturers with deep Android and iOS expertise. The second part of the course will lay the foundation to create mobile application designs that can truly stand the test of time. Some of the topics we’ll cover include: exploratory mobile research, gesture design, and touch design.

<p>Course material will be covered through lectures, in class activities, readings, and a group project. Early in the semester students will pitch mobile application ideas; they will spend the rest of the term iteratively designing the app with their teammates. Ongoing design critiques will be provided by the instructor, classmates, and industry leaders.</p>

However, our knowledge about how to effectively make, use, and present these media trails far behind our ability to create hours and gigabytes of content. Furthermore, it’s useful to consider how these resources are changing not just professional and research practice.</p>

<p>In this seminar, we will address both theoretical and practical issues of capturing and creating narratives with video, audio, and still images. We will draw on photojournalism, visual narrative, visual anthropology, visual studies, and related areas. We will get hands-on experience creating and editing our own media. This is not a technical course; nor is it a media production how-to. But you will get experience with media technologies while we reflect on them with the help of theoreticians and scholars in relevant areas.</p>

<p>This course is relevant to students in professional schools and to doctoral students interested in and qualitative research, including user experience research; technology designers who produce video scenarios and concept videos; and anyone concerned with collecting and presenting information via multiple media.</p>

<p>No prior experience is necessary, but students who are already grappling with visual (and audio) media will find this course especially useful. I School students are likely to find this course useful for the doing and presenting of final projects.</p></div>  </div>  </div>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-course-long-description">        <div class="field-content"><p>There are few terrains that evoke such socio-political anxieties and ambitions as the human body. Our contemporary moment is characterized by a shift in who can understand, analyze and ‘hack’ the body. Consumer biosensors, citizen science movements such as biohacking, and patient power movements such as participatory medicine, all use technology to challenge the status quo around who can demonstrate expertise about the body. They bring both opportunities and responsibilities. How do we engage with this computational turn that now marks the everyday experience of our biology?</p>

<p>In this course, we will take a close look at critical debates and scholarship about the body. We will draw from art, design, theory and activism. This course will introduce and ground itself in the philosophies of critical technical practice and reflective design. That is, not only will we examine the various ways in which society conceives of the body, through the lens of data, posthumanism, nation, race, gender and dis/ability, we will also unpack how we have been personally formed by those very debates and influences. What underlying values and assumptions do you bring to engaging the body through technology? What kinds of norms are you reinforcing with your actions? What would you like to change?</p>

<p>This course will culminate in a set of group projects, all in conversation with each other, that we will publish online in service to a public audience. Each group project will offer a critical and reflective perspective on a theme of your choosing. You will choose a trajectory most suitable to your learning and communication preference, from three tracks:</p>

<ol><li>
		<p>Unpack a narrative about the body with a curated digital archive/gallery of representations (text/video/image/sound).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Articulate reflective and critical perspectives in written essay format.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Design a speculative, critical or reflective digital artifact to challenge existing values and assumptions.</p>
	</li>
</ol><h4>Pedagogical Priorities</h4>

<p>Depending on your own prior experience, this class will begin, extend or support the following skills.</p>

<p><strong>Intersectionality</strong>: Analyze how concepts of the body are interconnected with other systems of power. These could include, but are not limited to gender, age, ability, literacy, race, and membership in privileged knowledge institutions (universities, scientific labs, medical institutions). Demonstrate how these categories are mutually constituted and intersect with different technological engagements with the body.</p>

<p><strong>Critical self-awareness</strong>: Demonstrate self-reflexivity about one’s values, ideas and goals, and how they are connected to one’s own body status and socio-economic position.</p>

<p><strong>Engaged Practice</strong>: Explore how to advocate for differences in bodies, identities, marginalized communities, and non-normative practices. Understand the ways in which knowledge institutions are assigned legitimacy. Learn to recognize and support other non-traditional and diverse ways of producing knowledge about the body that are also valuable.</p>

<p><strong>Creativity</strong>: Synthesize diverse perspectives, the aesthetics of writing/imagery/sound/touch, and activism to engage with issues of the body in a manner that is imaginative, inspiring and generative.</p></div>  </div>  </div>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-course-long-description">        <div class="field-content"><p>Students in this course will expand on their knowledge of techniques for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and collaborate on and contribute to a research project whose goal is to create a new framework for the EDA process.</p>

<p><strong>Topics and goals overview:</strong></p>

<p>Exploratory data analysis is an approach to examining data that emphasizes visually describing and interactively and iteratively inspecting data. EDA is the first step in data analysis, prior to performing confirmatory statistical analysis (such as conducting statistical tests or fitting statistical models; this topic is taught in <a href="/courses/i271b">Info 271B Quantitative Research Methods</a>, which is a terrific complement to this course). This distinction between exploratory and confirmatory statistics was originally championed by mathematical pioneer John Tukey, who said of EDA, “1. It is an attitude, <em>and </em> 2. a flexibility, <em>and</em>  3. some graph paper.”</p>

<p>Exploratory data analysis should be conducted before other types of analysis, in order to:</p>

<ul><li>evaluate data quality and identify additional data to collect, if necessary,</li>
	<li>suggest questions and hypotheses to pursue, or</li>
	<li>assess assumptions on which later analysis will be based.</li>
</ul><p>Exploratory data analysis techniques include:</p>

<ul><li>visualization techniques (histograms, scatter plots, parallel coordinates, etc.)</li>
	<li>projection methods (principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling, projection pursuit, t-SNE, etc.)</li>
	<li>unsupervised machine learning (clustering, pattern mining, anomaly detection, etc.)</li>
</ul><p>One challenge is that while there are a multitude of tools for data exploration, there is no established systematic understanding of or rules for guiding such exploration. Instead, data analysts learn how to do this work by slow trial and error or in an apprentice model from other analysts. Therefore, guidelines are needed to allow measurement of the amount of progress made in exploring a data set, to ensure complete coverage in exploration, to allow different sets of people to collaborate in exploring a data set individually and later combine their results, and to develop automated and intelligent assistance algorithms for data analysis interfaces.</p>

<p>Students in this course will expand their knowledge of and practice with exploratory data analysis techniques and at the same time will develop a repository of EDA case studies to be used to further our understanding of the EDA process. The first part of the course will consist of developing data sets and scenarios of use that can be used as examples, both for instruction and research, of best practices for EDA. The last few weeks of the course will be to help convert those examples into a systematic framework or theoretical model that characterizes the EDA process or processes, in order to guide future practice as well as to inform the design of new interactive data analysis tools.</p>

<p>Students will be expected to work together in teams and with the instructor to reach these goals. This is a research seminar, therefore students must be comfortable with open-ended problems, self-directed work and with setting their own goals.</p>

<p>The primary EDA tool used will be Tableau, but other programming abilities will be needed, e.g., for parsing and analyzing the Tableau log files, for wrangling data sets to get them into the right format, and so on. Students who are interested in the more analytic side of EDA (projection methods, clustering, etc) and who already have background in this area will be allowed to work on these problems, but must come to the course with strengths in those methods, as they will not be the focus of classroom work.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>

<p>Course is open to graduate students from all fields, at discretion of the instructor. Students should have taken either:</p>

<ul><li>Info 247 (Information Visualization and Presentation), or</li>
	<li>CS 294-10 (Information Visualization)</li>
</ul><p>Students will be expected to have:</p>

<ul><li>Enjoyed the EDA aspects of their infoviz course</li>
	<li>Familiarity with Tableau</li>
	<li>Proficiency in programming and the use of software engineering tools like the unix command line, databases, version control, some scripting language (Python, MATLAB or R will be useful)</li>
	<li>Ability to comfortably pick up new programming languages and software tools with minimal guidance</li>

But technology prognostication has a terrible track-record. And keying on worst-case and best-case possibilities is an unrealistic, inefficient, and sometimes dangerous way to generate insight. Scenario thinking is an alternate methodology, developed first by Royal Dutch Shell for use in the energy sector after the oil shocks of the 1970s and later extended more broadly to business, government, and non-profit sectors. Scenario thinking starts from the proposition that the future is unpredictable in any meaningful sense… and that it is possible instead to systematically develop a landscape of possible futures from which useful insights can be drawn, and against which strategic action can be planned. In this seminar we will learn, practice, and develop scenario thinking for the information economy and society. We’ll explore the scientific limits of prediction; decision biases in that setting; and alternative methods for gaining and communicating insight that changes what people think and what they do. We’ll develop our own scenarios and use them to explore systematically challenges and opportunities ahead for the things we care about — business ideas, governance challenges, social change, etc. This seminar will call on a high level of energy, creativity, and open-mindedness as well as great teamwork.</p></div>  </div>  </div>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-course-long-description">        <div class="field-content"><p>Network studies have been described as “a terminological jungle in which any newcomer may plant a tree.” Since J.A. Barnes wrote that in 1972, newcomers have proliferated, the jungle flourished, and the ecosystem diversified dramatically. This growth is particularly evident in the region of “social networks” — though it can sometimes be hard to envisage anything social that could not be called a network. The aim of this course, then, is to try to understand what has been described as the “modern obsession” with networks, to try to decide what might be valuable and what ephemeral, and to see if we can justify such decisions. For this, we will attempt to set some recent accounts in both disciplinary and historical context. Consequently, we will look at contributions from different fields and different periods. In particular, this seminar will seek to encourage dialogue among its participants by examining the implicit dialogue among the texts we shall be reading and the fields they represent, while keeping an eye on cases where, despite the shared terminology, the works seem to have nothing to say to each other.</p></div>  </div>  </div>

Scholars have labeled the contemporary era as the “post-industrial,” “postmodern,” or “network society,” but probably the most widely used and enduring characterization distinguishes the present day as the “information age” or “information society.” This course will explore the notion of an “information society,” trying to understand what scholars have held to be the essential and distinguishing features of such a society, how these views compare with classic theories of society or with alternative accounts of the present age, and to what extent different conceptions of the “information age” are compatible. In pursuing this investigation, we shall bear in mind the admonition of the legal scholar James Boyle that while the idea of an “information age” may be “useful ... we need a critical social theory to understand it.” In the process of developing a critical, social, and political-economic analysis of this idea, we hope to assemble a corpus of information society readings.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> We will proceed by reading theorists in contrasting pairs in each class seeking to understand and compare the ways in which society is characterized in each account. All students will be asked to post their thoughts on the readings before each class. Each student will be expected to take responsibility for guiding the discussion in one class. Every few weeks, we will pause to consider how to apply these theoretical perspectives in our own research and writing, at which time students will be required to submit a one- page essay reflecting on how the works read up to that point construct and use theory and how the student might rely on or challenge these theories in the student’s own work. Each student will be required to submit a final paper exploring a subject to be agreed on with the instructors that relates the works and discussions of the course to the student’s own work and interests. Papers should be twenty pages long and submitted by the last day of exam week (December 16).</p></div>  </div>  </div>

While the Web is still a work in progress, salient characteristics such as the collapse of distance, the discovery of like-minded groups, and information delivered in short bursts are already affecting the way people see themselves and the way they consume information. Following an overview on the relationship of technology with identity and communications, the course will look at the uses of narrative in news, public relations, advertising, entertainment, and online gaming.</p>

<p>We will address a wide range of topics: the economics of media organizations (and industries), their organizational structures, cultures, brands, and approaches.</p>

<p>Some of the questions we'll discuss:</p>

<ul><li>­How do traditional media address changing technologies?</li>
	<li>­How is the media business driven by metrics and data? How is it driven by artistic creativity?</li>
	<li>­Are media companies too big? Are they too small?</li>
</ul><p>Students will present strategies for media companies, hear from guest speakers, and discuss the transformations happening in media. Students should expect to have significant input into the companies and topics we discuss.</p>

<p>We will make every attempt to avoid predictions about the future; we might occasionally succeed.</p>

<ul><li>What does it mean to “have a theoretical perspective?”</li>
	<li>How do you come to recognize different theoretical stances as you read and consider the work of others?</li>
	<li>What are the implications of those differences for scholarly work and social engagement with the world?</li>
</ul><p>One way to take up these questions is to look closely at how scholars/researchers approach the same problem from different perspectives. The course will take as a central text for this examination <em>Understanding Practice: Perspectives on Activity and Context</em> (Chaiklin and Lave, editors). All researchers in this collection of ethnographic studies address issues about learning, knowledge and social practice. The challenge for the seminar is to inquire into the theoretical stances that permeate these projects — similarly and differently. This will involve attempting to answer the seminar questions as we go along. Besides being more acute readers of academic work by the end of the seminar, students will have (we hope) a hands-on grasp of the craft of social theorizing, and an introduction to contrasting theories of learning, knowledge, context, and practice.</p></div>  </div>  </div>

Together you will take on a data-driven project, focused on solving a challenging issue for one of Accenture’s clients. Your team will take the challenge from data assessment and problem definition through to final client recommendations.  The outcome of your project should be a set of strategic and tactical recommendations to increase the client’s effectiveness. </p>

<p>Successful analytics projects require managerial discipline, iterative problem solving skills, a solid grounding in the client’s business (whether an internal or external client) effective communications with both team and client, and data analytics tools and techniques  — including data set analysis, modeling, interpretation, and presentation.  The primary objective of this course — and of the projects — is to gain valuable experience in applying the approaches, skills, and tools needed to have an impact on business results through the use of data analytics.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul><li>The course runs 8 weeks, starting October 19.</li>
	<li>The focus is on the project based application of data to drive a client’s business decision making. We will not be teaching the technical foundations or practical software for data analytics:  Students are expected to contribute prior knowledge either in hard data analytics skills or strategic analysis of business problems using data-driven frameworks.   As a result, we require that students have completed the basic data course (Data Science and Data Strategy). Equivalent work experience or prior background may also be accepted.  Please contact the <a href="mailto:Haas@Work">Haas@Work</a> program office for further details</li>
	<li>For each project, there will be 2-3 formal client workshops/presentations outside of normal Monday evening class hours, in addition to the normal outside work and coordination needed to manage your client, the deliverables, and your team responsibilities.</li>
	<li>Once assigned a project, you may be required to sign an NDA and IP waiver</li>
	<li>As is the case with many of the Experiential learning courses,  we need to make early client commitments and share information in advance of the  course. Therefore, please note that there is no add/drop period for this course.</li>

This course, however, looks at a different intersection between information and business. Specifically, it will explore how entrepreneurs across the world are developing ventures fundamentally centered on new and emerging information technologies and the business models and strategies they make possible. These include not only the Googles, Amazons, and Facebooks of the world, but also ventures like Comat and Samasource. In some cases, these are efforts on the proverbial cutting edge of technology; more often they involve creative application and/or integration of existing information technologies in innovative ways.</p>

<p>We will first examine the key elements of business models and the entrepreneurial process, before looking in more detail at a variety of ventures leveraging information-based technologies and strategies in an array of markets. Using of mix of case-study discussion, short lectures, and focused conversations with active entrepreneurs, this will be a highly interactive and collaborative course — not a sit-listen-take-notes type of class.</p>

<p>Expect to be actively involved in a series of in-class and outside assignments, both individual- and team-based, that will help you develop an understanding of how entrepreneurs are using information-centric technologies to create new markets and redefine old ones, and the lessons learned along the way. You may also explore your own ideas for new ventures along the way.</p>

We will focus on both the theory and real-world cases of the Internet mobilizing people by spreading alternative views and news — and the parallel emergence of collective identity and civic action. Students will read books on communication power, watch documentary films on the Arab Spring, and do case studies about US, Iran, China, and elsewhere. The class will also look into issues such as online surveillance and filtering, circumvention tools, and how repressive regimes have countered digital activism.</p>

<p>In addition to analytic readings, students will engage in collective knowledge-gathering and construct a resource wiki as public good. Students will do individual or group projects relating to concepts and themes discussed in this course.</p>

<p>It is expected that these issues will require attention to a number of questions about the nature of information retrieval processes, the feasibility of not-yet-conventional techniques, techniques of making different systems work together, social impact, and the reconsideration of past practices. More generally, the seminar is intended to provide a forum for advanced students in the School. Anyone interested in these topics is welcome to join in -- and to talk about their own work.

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-course-long-description">        <div class="field-content"><p>Information technology has been integrated into an array of complex interactions between individuals and the state. Often these technological changes are put forth as inevitable progress toward modernization and as value-neutral means for acting upon policies established through the political branch of government. However, the adoption or introduction of specific technology can obscure profound policy choices and options. Obscurity can arise due to barriers to transparency created by law, such as intellectual property rights asserted to prevent the analysis of software code used in electronic voting systems, due to a lack of necessary expertise to understand the ramifications of a technological shift within the public and private sector entities focused on the relevant policy issues, or, more fundamentally, due to shifts in technology that remove or shift the assumptions on which earlier policies were developed. As a result, the agency, the public, and the political branch of government may overlook the policy-implications in the choice of a new technology.<br /><br />
	Through background readings from a range of disciplines and case studies this class will explore instances of discretion delegated to, or embedded in technology--unpacking the process, the substantive outcomes, and the responses from various communities--policy makers, academics, vendors--and disciplines. We will consider techniques for identifying policy issues in technical design, and delegations to technical experts through technology adoption. We will consider the risks and benefits of embedding value and policy choices through technical design versus the adoption of policies or procedures, and rigorously consider the hand-off among them. Topics will include the policy implications of standards, the process and implication of translating law into technological forms, governance implications of government adoption of technology, and government use of technology to regulate behavior and make decisions. </p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-field-course-long-description">        <div class="field-content"><p>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has emerged as the primary regulator of online privacy. In a recent case, the FTC marked the end of contract law approaches to online privacy in favor of a more interventionalist approach. Years of protecting consumers against “harm” has evolved to an attempt to protect consumer “dignity” in online commerce.</p>

<p>This transition has profound implications for US online commerce. In grounding privacy rights in dignitary interests, the line between acceptable and unacceptable behaviors will become less clear. Those wishing to represent online businesses should have a strong understanding of this agency, its norms, and approaches to address clients’ business challenges. This seminar will explore the agency’s dominance in the law of online privacy and security, its policy approaches, and in particular, how it should address growing concern over online privacy.</p>

<p>Students will be required to prepare a significant policy document on the FTC that will be shared with the agency’s leadership. Additionally, students will author a shorter paper focusing upon some aspect of the FTC or its leadership. (We post these on wikipedia.org). </p>

<p>The concept of “organizing system” that is presented in <a href="http://disciplineoforganizing.org/"><em>The Discipline of Organizing</em></a> is proving to be a useful and generative framework for analyzing existing resource collections and designing novel ones.  But the multidisciplinary breadth of TDO and its new abstractions can make it challenging as a textbook. </p>

<p>The plan for this seminar is to read three (or more) books on organizing that take widely different perspectives — cognitive, policy/procedural, even spiritual — on the ubiquitous problems of how to select, arrange, interact with, and maintain resources.  The goal is to find new insights that can be incorporated into The Discipline of Organizing to improve its future editions for general readers and students alike.</p>

<p>We start the semester by all reading these two books:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Organized-Mind-Thinking-Straight-Information/dp/052595418X/"><em>The Organized Mind: Thinking Straight in the Age of Information Overload</em> (Daniel Levitin) 2014</a></li>

</ul><p>and we end the semester by reading one or more of these (students choose one; the professor will read them all):</p>
