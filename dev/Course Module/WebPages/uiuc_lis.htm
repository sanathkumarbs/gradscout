This course develops such a  framework, by examining emergent information institutions and practices from early modern Europe to the later 20th century. It examines the historical development of the information society through a number of important conceptual lenses, including: modernity and post-modernity; Fordist and post-Fordist capitalism; social class and information poverty; social and technological determinism; utopianism and dystopianism; and empire and globalization. This course currently counts as an elective in the informatics minor and will count as a required core course for the informatics major once that degree program is approved.

         <td>Hands-on introduction to technology systems for use in information environments. The course steps students through choosing, installing, and managing computer hardware and operating systems, as well as networking hardware and software. The course also explores alternatives for administering IT and how to assess emerging technologies and their applicability to library settings. While students are expected to have basic computer competencies per the GSLIS admissions requirements, the goal of the course is to provide practical detailed knowledge of the technology for all levels of competency. The primary objective is to provide a conceptual understanding of the topics of the day through concrete hands-on examples of implementation. By learning the underlying concepts, students will be better prepared to help design networked systems that not only work well today, but also develop systems that can be easily adapted for the needs and technologies of tomorrow. Field trip fee required for 6 credit hour lecture/lab (service project) option. [Revised description and credit options effective Fall 2012]</td>

This enables developers to show how their envisaged working interactive technology will be used productively in a particular real-life context. Communicating the vision of computational devices is a challenge because dynamic use in context is hard for people other than the device's developers to imagine. The ability to produce convincing, clear, powerful demonstrations even at the early stages of a project is a highly valuable entrepreneurial skill, and also highly applicable within an organization.

Drawing upon scholarship in LIS, education, literature, history, sociology, psychology, and anthropology, and with special consideration given to the dimensions of age, gender, class, religion, and culture, we will expand upon traditional notions of literacy and explore the range of scholarly approaches to the study of literacy, reading, and readers.

Over the last fifty years, oral history has moved from a controversial (and sometimes despised) technique on the margins of the discipline history, to one of the most important forms of historical knowledge production and dissemination in the academic and non-academic worlds. Yet its goals and relations to the communities it touches are often less than clear. Examines oral historical works, some canonical, some experimental, produced by historians, anthropologists, folklorists, sociologists and political activists. Up for discussion are questions of orality and literacy, privileged versus marginal histories, the problem of memory, problems of listening and learning how to ask, and debates about audience and presentation. Readings will cross continents (the Americas, Europe, Africa, South America) and historical periods from the 18th through the 21st centuries.

These materials tell the story of groups of people who have often been excluded from mainstream archives, which have tended to focus on official documents and the lives of elites. We will investigate the role community archives play in supporting a sense of heritage and identity amongst members of a community and how they serve to raise awareness of these neglected stories in the wider public. Will work with local organizations that have agreed to take part, and students will contribute to the work of their archives by assisting in identifying records of long term value, documenting the experience of its members, providing the organization with practical and affordable solutions within a framework of best practice of archives and records management, and working collaboratively with the organizations to secure the long-term viability of their documentary heritage.[Elective course for the Graduate Certificate in Special Colls] [First offered Spring 2010]</td>

To prepare us for addressing these problems, this course explores the fundamental nature of the key entities in our field. The method of approach will be conceptual analysis and formal ontology. The course will be conducted as an advanced seminar. Although there are no specific prerequisites, students should be comfortable learning and using formal languages.

This class will look at the ways that each of these communities reacts to these crimes and the reasons for these varied reactions. The class will also trace the evolution of the way these crimes have been viewed by various communities and what recent, positive changes might mean for the future.   Aside from the historical and theoretical, this class will also discuss the practical: how these crimes are committed and by whom as well as how they can be (and are being) prevented.

Techniques may include approaches from the database community, which has developed a number of techniques for data cleaning using schema-level and instance-level information, or from different scientific communities, which are developing practical tools for data pre-processing and cleaning. The course will include readings on the foundations of data quality and data cleaning, and hands-on projects and exercises to work with existing data cleaning tools, including some programming exercises to develop your own simple tools.

         <td>Data mining refers to the process of exploring large datasets with the goal of uncovering interesting patterns. This process usually involves a number of tasks such as data collection, pre-processing, and characterization; model fitting, selection, and evaluation; classification, clustering, and prediction. Although data mining has its roots in database management, it has grown into a discipline that focuses on algorithm design (to ensure computational feasibility) and statistical modeling (to separate the signal from the noise). It draws heavily upon a variety of other disciplines including statistics, machine learning, operations research, and information retrieval. Will cover the major data mining concepts, principles, and techniques that *every information scientist should know about.* Lectures will introduce and discuss the major approaches to data mining; computer lab sessions coupled with assignments will provide hands-on experience with these approaches; term projects offer the opportunity to use data mining in a novel way. Mathematical detail will be left to the students who are so inclined. [First offered Spring 2009]</td>

We will elucidate what these related fields focus on, showing interrelationships, and preparing practitioners to speak with authority about books as bearers of texts and as artifacts. Looks at such things as how to compile and focus, design and present an enumerative bibliography; how to describe books (esp. those from the hand-press period--up through about 1800) for cataloging, buying, selling, and doing scholarly research; the book as a historical artifact, with respect to its creation, dissemination, and the effect it had on the culture (along with the effect the culture had on the world of publishing); the development of authoritative, accurately and definitively edited texts; and more.

Can the ceiling support a replica of a sea mine? Can we devise a secure vitrine for this priceless manuscript? Does this meet ADA restrictions? How will everything fit together? Can we get that look? This course will address how  exhibitions attains a specific "look"? This is not a course on developing or curating the information, but rather a course on presenting that information in the most compelling way. We will look at the planning, fabricating, painting, building, and installing are large parts of our work. We also have to consider that nothing, with few exceptions, is permanent. Our work needs to be secure and stable, but also reversible to make way for the next show. We will also survey the conceptual and procedural dimensions of carrying an exhibition through from curatorial musings to the reality of opening night. We will cover the techniques and processes that begin with a dialogue and move into the concrete. We will discuss the "what's possible" response to the initial idea. We will discuss the collaborative aspects of working with Curators, Directors of Cultural Institutions,  Registrars, Collections Managers and Architects. The course will be a mix of discussion and hands-on experience with some courses taking place in the Krannert Art Museum workshop.</td>

         <td>Human-Centered information retrieval (HCIR) engages aspects of information retrieval that bear specifically on peoples' experiences with retrieval systems and processes.  This course will entail a sustained engagement with the literature, theories, and techniques that comprise HCIR. The course will include a historical overview of HCIR's development.  But it will focus mainly on emerging research and innovations in the field.  Major areas of discussion will include theories of relevance, modes of system interaction (e.g. retrieval, browsing, recommendation), interaction design, and the evaluation of HCIR systems.  Aside from doctoral standing, the course has no formal prerequisites.  However, students will benefit from previous exposure to information retrieval, human-computer interaction, and aspects of statistics such as linear models and basic probability.

This course will examine healthcare infrastructure through lectures and discussions, through text readings and web sites.  There is a particular focus on measuring the health of populations, in the demographic era of chronic illness.  Information sources are discussed in detail from medical literature and records to health brochures and monitors.  There are no pre-requisites for this course, but students encouraged to use background experiences. Practical topics will be emphasized with the aim of revolutionizing an industry in transition.

As common as such activities are some fundamental problems in conceptualization of change and identity for digital objects remain unsolved.

Recently, it has been expanded to include webometrics (e.g., to characterize the structure and growth of the world wide web), and other domain specific-metrics. Lectures and discussion will broadly survey the literature on informetrics and study specific cases in depth, striking a balance between fundamental principles vs. applications that demonstrate the value of informetrics. Computer laboratory sessions and assignments will include the use of datasets and tools to teach how to perform informetric analyses. Term projects offer the opportunity to address novel informetrics-related research questions and can be tailored to the students' own interests. [First offered Fall 2009]</td>

Yet its goals and relations to the communities it touches are often less than clear.  Examines oral historical works, some canonical, some experimental, produced by historians, anthropologists, folklorists, sociologists and political activists. Up for discussion are questions of orality and literacy, privileged versus marginal histories, the problem of memory, problems of listening and learning how to ask, and debates about audience and presentation.  Readings will cross continents (the Americas, Europe, Africa, South America) and historical periods from the 18th through the 21st centuries. [First offered Spring 2012]</td>

         <td>An introduction to the history and practices of book collecting, with particular emphasis on collecting and collectors in Britain and America from the eighteenth century to the present.  Most special collections libraries are actually "collections of collections," and most of these collections were assembled by private book collectors who followed the tastes and collecting principles and standards of their own times.  The course will cover these changing tastes and fashions in book collecting over the last several centuries, as well as the various ways that collectors have regarded rarity, condition, association, and provenance.  The gradual broadening of collectors' ideas of the scope of subjects suitable for the formation of a collection will also be included.  The course does not assume any prior experience with rare books - all necessary terminology will be covered in the course readings and lectures.

         <td>Between the Black Death and the Break with Rome the cultural life of Western Europe was transformed. Even before moveable metal type came out of the Rhineland, old orthodoxies had been unsettled by novel scholarship, fervent classicism and vigorous, vernacular polemic carried in manuscript to a widening constituency of consumers. Print cemented these novelties and created a responsive reading public. It was this engaged, social community of readers that ensured renewed calls for reform around 1517 were not to be stifled and which became the focus of princely and pontifical efforts to confessionalize the continent. These remarkable changes might be studied by means of particular authors, texts or indeed the more dominant ideas but this course will focus on arguably the most powerful agents, the books themselves. In each seminar, an original book from the period will act as a point-of-entry into the key developments, and their effects for the people of Europe. Class presentation and a 20-page seminar paper for submission at the close of the eight-week course.  [Meets w/MDVL 501A.  Medieval Studies is lead dept.] [First offered Fall 2013]</td>

However exactly how identifiers identify remains very poorly understood. We review research on the semantics of referring expressions and explore applications of this work to URIs (Universal Resource Identifiers), identifiers that provide not only the foundation for the World Wide Web, but are fundamental to the knowledge representation languages RDF and OWL. Authors of particular focus include Frege, Russell, Searle, Kripke, Donnellan, Putnam, Evans, and Soames, as well as current research on problems with the use of URIs in RDF and OWL.

This steady increase in population means that the number of Spanish-speakers using public and academic libraries is also on the rise. 
 
In this 8-week course, students will pick a type of library (public, community college, or academic) to use for their assignments. The assignments will include answering reference or research queries, creating user guides, and selecting Spanish-language materials to build a collection supporting their user population.  Students are encouraged to try to attend the bookfair in Guadalajara, Mexico in order to use the bookfair as a laboratory for the courses final project (partial travel grants can be sought through ALAs Free Pass program; travel would begin Saturday or Sunday after Thanksgiving). Attendance at the bookfair is not required and students unable to travel will have alternate means of completing all assignments. All course work will be done in English and Spanish is not a requirement for this course.

         <td>(A WISE course.)The health of any profession depends on the vigorous exchange of news, knowledge, and ideas, and today the field of library and information science (LIS) is especially vibrant. Libraries and their services are evolving, adapting to new technologies and user needs. Information issues are reaching across disciplines and communities and touching people everywhere, inside and outside the library. By writing about library and information subjects, we can support our profession and reach out to our communities. We can share, inform, and advocate. There's plenty to write about and plenty of publishing venues, in print and online. In fact, there are more professional publishing opportunities available to us today than ever before: professional journals &amp; newsletters, weblogs &amp; discussion lists, magazines &amp; newspapers. To maintain the richness and relevancy of their content, many of these publications depend on the work of authors, editors, reviewers, other contributors. If you like to write and have something to say about LIS, this is a great time to start developing your ideas, sharing your work, and building your own portfolio of publications.</td>

The approach to the seminar is to use synchronous and asynchronous learning techniques to break the boundaries of space, time and distance. Using a geographically-distributed computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) pedagogical model, the seminar employs a suite of web-based tools to create a highly interactive, globally networked collaborative learning environment. Within this learning environment, seminar participants explore the socio-economic, political and cultural implications of globalization and the on-going development of a knowledge-based Information Society. The seminar takes a global multi-stakeholder approach, with particular emphasis on the responses to these issues from the perspectives of Africa, the developing world, and the civil society sector.</td>

In this course we will consider the reading interests of boys and young men aged ten to eighteen, develop criteria for evaluating books for this audience, and explore the challenges unique to maintaining their interests in literature. We will examine the voices of boys and men who have told their own stories and consider books of particular interest to middle and high school males. This course is a seminar; there will be heavy emphasis on reading and discussions.</td>

You will explore the picture books of Dr. Seuss, Maurice Sendak, and Peter Sis, considering issues such as the use of history made by each illustrator and his concern for social context, the relationship of image to text and of illustration to a linear narrative, and repeating motifs and symbols that join individual publications into an organic whole. Students in the course will be divided into groups which will explore the three illustrators; this exploration will include a look at work by other important 20th century contemporaries such as Hillary Knight, Mitsumasa Anno, and Quentin Blake. The final weeks of the semester will be a conference period during which the groups will share some of the papers they have written and together discover how different perceptions, research, and group dynamics led to alternate hypotheses about these three masters.</td>

Core readings investigate three aspects of public librarianship: the philosophy that impacts public and practitioner perceptions of public libraries; the political position of public libraries, often related to those philosophical foundations; how policies, drafted in response to the philosophy, are implemented to deliver public library services. Students demonstrate their engagement with this framework by developing a case study investigating a particular implementation of one of these policies / practices in an actual library. Topics have included such elements as the impact of participation in a public library system on a single rural library(WI); the role of policy in addressing public emergencies (IA); the impact of intentional outreach models on the delivery of public services (MN); tax policy and its impact on library construction (WI). The research method is the case study. Online participation in discussions is highly valued in the course. [Updated description effective Spring 2013]</td>

When you know more about what is possible with a mobile device (and what isn't), you are more empowered to successfully design and deliver services to your users that they may not have expected. In this course you will -learn about designing services for mobile platforms -explore the decision making process for designing mobile based services -learn the basics of developing web applications for use on multiple platform -learn about deploying mobile applications We will try to answer the following questions -What services lend themselves well to the mobile space and how can we deliver them? -What services do not work well in the mobile space? -What new services might be discovered and delivered through a mobile environment. This course assumes a basic knowledge of web technologies (HTML, CSS, etc) but that you may have never programmed an application before. While some programming experience may be helpful, it also assumes that any prior experience might not be in an object-oriented programming environment. The goal is to go from having little to no programming experience to being able to understand and navigate an integrated development environment and understand the requirements for deploying a mobile application on various platforms.

         <td>&lt;p&gt;[A WISE course San Jose State University, INFO 220] Embedding the library into the fabric of higher education. This course will explore the creative and proactive strategies academic libraries are employing to embed librarians, library presence, library collections, research support, and library instruction into the curriculum, student success initiatives, and patron points of need. In an era in which some students and faculty bypass the library entirely, librarians are developing innovative services that take them outside the library &amp;mdash; both online and face-to-face &amp;mdash; to provide services where their patrons are. This requires deep knowledge of one&amp;rsquo;s patrons and the academic environment, as well as an understanding of best practices for collaboration. We will explore best practices for embedding the library into the fabric of higher education through the literature as well as through significant written reflection and discussion. 3 credit hours, Virtual&lt;/p&gt;
