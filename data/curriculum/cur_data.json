Even before moveable metal type came out of the Rhineland, old orthodoxies had been unsettled by novel scholarship, fervent classicism and vigorous, vernacular polemic carried in manuscript to a widening constituency of consumers. Print cemented these novelties and created a responsive reading public. It was this engaged, social community of readers that ensured renewed calls for reform around 1517 were not to be stifled and which became the focus of princely and pontifical efforts to confessionalize the continent. These remarkable changes might be studied by means of particular authors, texts or indeed the more dominant ideas but this course will focus on arguably the most powerful agents, the books themselves. In each seminar, an original book from the period will act as a point-of-entry into the key developments, and their effects for the people of Europe.

Even before moveable metal type came out of the Rhineland, old orthodoxies had been unsettled by novel scholarship, fervent classicism and vigorous, vernacular polemic carried in manuscript to a widening constituency of consumers. Print cemented these novelties and created a responsive reading public. It was this engaged, social community of readers that ensured renewed calls for reform around 1517 were not to be stifled and which became the focus of princely and pontifical efforts to confessionalize the continent. These remarkable changes might be studied by means of particular authors, texts or indeed the more dominant ideas but this course will focus on arguably the most powerful agents, the books themselves. In each seminar, an original book from the period will act as a point-of-entry into the key developments, and their effects for the people of Europe. Class presentation and a 20-page seminar paper for submission at the close of the eight-week course. [Meets w/MDVL 501A.

[Elective course for the Graduate Certificate in Special Collections] [First offered Summer 2008] LIS590SS 2 or 4 GR hours Identifiers for such things as cultural objects, natural objects, persons, places and times, institutions, events, processes, data and datasets, substances, and even properties and mathematical values, play a fundamental role in information systems, and particularly in emerging areas such as contemporary metadata languages, ontologies, and linked data. However exactly how identifiers identify remains very poorly understood. We review research on the semantics of referring expressions and explore applications of this work to URIs (Universal Resource Identifiers), identifiers that provide not only the foundation for the World Wide Web, but are fundamental to the knowledge representation languages RDF and OWL. Authors of particular focus include Frege, Russell, Searle, Kripke, Donnellan, Putnam, Evans, and Soames, as well as current research on problems with the use of URIs in RDF and OWL. [First offered Spring 2011] LIS590SSL 2 GR hours Most librarians will at some point in their careers have the opportunity to work with patrons who are seeking resources in Spanish.

User experience and design thinking can be applied to all aspects of libraries: from everything in your physical buildings to your librarys online presence. Librarians are the designers of the way users experience library services, resources, and programs. In this course, you will explore: -The relationship between design thinking, user experience, and innovation -Touchpoints found in library buildings -The user experience elements of library website -Usability techniques and website improvements -UX for the future of libraries Good design, in library buildings and online, goes much deeper than choosing colors; it requires learning about communities and meeting their needs. Youll gain a toolbox of UX techniques, including user interviews, surveys, focus groups, personas, customer journey maps, and contextual inquiries. With a sharper analytical eye and UX design skills, youll be able to optimize, create, and innovate for current and future library users. [First offered Summer 2-14] LIS590X63 3 hours [A WISE course.

LIS590X64 3 GR hours [A WISE course. San Jose State University Libr 287] As more and more of our population embraces mobile technologies, including smartphones and tablets, they are expecting the services offered to them to follow that path. When you know more about what is possible with a mobile device (and what isnt), you are more empowered to successfully design and deliver services to your users that they may not have expected. In this course you will -learn about designing services for mobile platforms -explore the decision making process for designing mobile based services -learn the basics of developing web applications for use on multiple platform -learn about deploying mobile applications We will try to answer the following questions -What services lend themselves well to the mobile space and how can we deliver them? -What services do not work well in the mobile space? -What new services might be discovered and delivered through a mobile environment. This course assumes a basic knowledge of web technologies (HTML, CSS, etc) but that you may have never programmed an application before. While some programming experience may be helpful, it also assumes that any prior experience might not be in an object-oriented programming environment. The goal is to go from having little to no programming experience to being able to understand and navigate an integrated development environment and understand the requirements for deploying a mobile application on various platforms.

LIS590X67 3 <p>[A WISE course San Jose State University, INFO 220] Embedding the library into the fabric of higher education. This course will explore the creative and proactive strategies academic libraries are employing to embed librarians, library presence, library collections, research support, and library instruction into the curriculum, student success initiatives, and patron points of need. In an era in which some students and faculty bypass the library entirely, librarians are developing innovative services that take them outside the library &mdash; both online and face-to-face &mdash; to provide services where their patrons are. This requires deep knowledge of one&rsquo;s patrons and the academic environment, as well as an understanding of best practices for collaboration. We will explore best practices for embedding the library into the fabric of higher education through the literature as well as through significant written reflection and discussion. 3 credit hours, Virtual</p> LIS590YRL 2 hours LIS591 2 GR hours Supervised field experience of professional-level duties in an approved library or information center.

"4.htm" : "Director of undergraduate studies: James Aspnes, 401 AKW, 432-1232, james.aspnes@yale.edu; cpsc.yale.edu The Computer Science and combined major programs share a common core of five computer science courses. The first is CPSC 201, a survey that demonstrates the breadth and depth of the field to students who have taken the equivalent of an introductory programming course. The remaining core courses cover discrete mathematics, data structures, systems programming and computer architecture, and algorithm analysis and design. Together these courses include the material that every major should know. Introductory courses The department offers a broad range of introductory courses to meet the needs of students with varying backgrounds and interests. Except for CPSC 200 and CPSC 201, none assumes previous knowledge of computers. Requirements of the major The B.S. and the B.A. degree programs have the same required core courses: CPSC 201; CPSC 202 or MATH 244; CPSC 223, 323, 365, and 490. The B.S. degree program requires six additional intermediate or advanced courses in Computer Science, for a total of twelve; the B.A. degree program, four, for a total of ten. CPSC 480 and 490 may not be counted toward these electives. All courses in the major must be taken for a letter grade. Students majoring in Computer Science are advised to complete CPSC 201 and 223 by the end of the sophomore year. Students considering graduate study in computer science are advised to take CPSC 421 and 422, as well as courses covering the breadth of computer science, including programming languages and systems, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and theoretical computer science. Students interested in using computers to solve scientific and engineering problems are advised to take CPSC 440 as well as computational courses offered in Applied Mathematics and in Engineering and Applied Science. The core mathematical background necessary to complete the Computer Science major is provided in CPSC 202. However, many advanced courses in graphics, computer vision, neural networks, and numerical analysis assume additional knowledge of linear algebra and calculus. Students who plan to take such courses as electives and who are unsure whether they have the appropriate mathematical background are encouraged to take MATH 222 or 225 and MATH 120.

The first is CPSC 201, a survey that demonstrates the breadth and depth of the field to students who have taken the equivalent of an introductory programming course. The remaining core courses cover discrete mathematics, data structures, systems programming and computer architecture, and algorithm analysis and design. Together these courses include the material that every major should know. Introductory courses The department offers a broad range of introductory courses to meet the needs of students with varying backgrounds and interests. Except for CPSC 200 and CPSC 201, none assumes previous knowledge of computers. Requirements of the major The B.S. and the B.A. degree programs have the same required core courses: CPSC 201; CPSC 202 or MATH 244; CPSC 223, 323, 365, and 490. The B.S. degree program requires six additional intermediate or advanced courses in Computer Science, for a total of twelve; the B.A. degree program, four, for a total of ten. CPSC 480 and 490 may not be counted toward these electives. All courses in the major must be taken for a letter grade. Students majoring in Computer Science are advised to complete CPSC 201 and 223 by the end of the sophomore year. Students considering graduate study in computer science are advised to take CPSC 421 and 422, as well as courses covering the breadth of computer science, including programming languages and systems, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and theoretical computer science. Students interested in using computers to solve scientific and engineering problems are advised to take CPSC 440 as well as computational courses offered in Applied Mathematics and in Engineering and Applied Science.

The first is CPSC 201, a survey that demonstrates the breadth and depth of the field to students who have taken the equivalent of an introductory programming course. The remaining core courses cover discrete mathematics, data structures, systems programming and computer architecture, and algorithm analysis and design. Together these courses include the material that every major should know. Introductory courses The department offers a broad range of introductory courses to meet the needs of students with varying backgrounds and interests. Except for CPSC 200 and CPSC 201, none assumes previous knowledge of computers. Requirements of the major The B.S. and the B.A. degree programs have the same required core courses: CPSC 201; CPSC 202 or MATH 244; CPSC 223, 323, 365, and 490. The B.S. degree program requires six additional intermediate or advanced courses in Computer Science, for a total of twelve; the B.A. degree program, four, for a total of ten. CPSC 480 and 490 may not be counted toward these electives. All courses in the major must be taken for a letter grade. Students majoring in Computer Science are advised to complete CPSC 201 and 223 by the end of the sophomore year. Students considering graduate study in computer science are advised to take CPSC 421 and 422, as well as courses covering the breadth of computer science, including programming languages and systems, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and theoretical computer science. Students interested in using computers to solve scientific and engineering problems are advised to take CPSC 440 as well as computational courses offered in Applied Mathematics and in Engineering and Applied Science. The core mathematical background necessary to complete the Computer Science major is provided in CPSC 202. However, many advanced courses in graphics, computer vision, neural networks, and numerical analysis assume additional knowledge of linear algebra and calculus. Students who plan to take such courses as electives and who are unsure whether they have the appropriate mathematical background are encouraged to take MATH 222 or 225 and MATH 120. Senior requirement In the senior year students must take CPSC 490, an independent project course in which students select an adviser to guide them in research in a subfield of computer science. With permission of the director of undergraduate studies, students may enroll in 490 more than once or before their senior year.
