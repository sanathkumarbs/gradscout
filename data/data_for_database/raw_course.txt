It examines the historical development of the information society through a number of important conceptual lenses, including: modernity and post-modernity; Fordist and post-Fordist capitalism; social class and information poverty; social and technological determinism; utopianism and dystopianism; and empire and globalization.

Even before moveable metal type came out of the Rhineland, old orthodoxies had been unsettled by novel scholarship, fervent classicism and vigorous, vernacular polemic carried in manuscript to a widening constituency of consumers. Print cemented these novelties and created a responsive reading public. It was this engaged, social community of readers that ensured renewed calls for reform around 1517 were not to be stifled and which became the focus of princely and pontifical efforts to confessionalize the continent. These remarkable changes might be studied by means of particular authors, texts or indeed the more dominant ideas but this course will focus on arguably the most powerful agents, the books themselves. In each seminar, an original book from the period will act as a point-of-entry into the key developments, and their effects for the people of Europe.
